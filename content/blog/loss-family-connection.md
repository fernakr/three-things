Did not mean to make this so long / so deep and don't anticipate that being a long-running trend, but just what's currently on my mind

1. Currently reading **Option B** by **Sheryl Sandberg** where she talks about how she dealt with the sudden loss of her husband - specifically processing what she says about how we shouldn't tiptoe around people who are dealing with loss or act like nothing is happening because that can feel even more isolating

1. Been thinking lately about how **family** doesn't always have the same connotation for everyone and how that is a privilege that I have in my life to have such a supportive and uplifting family who make me laugh all of the time

1. Also just wrapped up **If You Lived Here You'd Be Home By Now** by **Christopher Ingraham** which is about a Washington Post reporter who wrote an article about the "ugliest county in America" based on rankings that he received - long story short, he ends up moving there and the story ends up being about a broader conversation on how we're losing the idea of creating communities in the places that we live in America especially in bigger cities. This compounded with a podcast that I was listening to on happiness that surveyed people on whether they wanted to interact with other people on a train before their ride, then surveying people after their ride where one group did interact vs the other group that did not have to interact. The results demonstrated that we think we do not want to have this human contact but in reality, we enjoy ourselves more when we actually do have this human interaction. Both the book and this study feel intrinsically related to this human idea that 1) we don't know what actually is good for us and 2) the fear of being vulnerable or inconvenienced outweighs our desire for human connection, despite the fact that this connection is important for our well-being
