1. Reading **Uninhabitable Earth** by **David Wallace Wells** and thinking about how we see this impending doom that is climate change / global warming and yet there is an overall complacency about it. Is it because the effects feel so far removed from us in our everyday lives? Or because we feel powerless to affect real change so we just carry on and try to forget that it's happening? Or we don't care about other people in places that are less fortunate or about humanity in the future?

1. Listened to an episode of **Making Sense** by **Sam Harris** about race - Sam and his guest were talking about race being an uninteresting grouping that is also impossible to really quantify e.g. when does a person's racial breakdown make them a white person - is it %-based? Is it more self-identification? Or about how society identifies you? I agree that race is one of those systems that we as humans use to make sense in the world and having a system like this can be potentially dangerous in the wrong hands - e.g. generalizations made about race to justify racism - however, we have other systems in place that are similarly arbitrary like dates/calendars that can provide positive affects because we have layers built upon these systems like birthdays/holidays that certainly aren't necessary but give life a human element that makes life that special quality. Similarly, race begets systems like culture and traditions and identity that give us a place and meaning in this world/life.

1. TBD
